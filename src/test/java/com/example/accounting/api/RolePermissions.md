## Key Differences Between Roles

1. **Account Management**: 
   - **OWNER**: Can perform all account operations, including deletion
   - **ACCOUNTANT**: Can create, view, and update accounts but cannot delete them
   - **EMPLOYEE**: Can only view accounts, cannot create, update, or delete them

2. **Transaction and Invoice Management**:
   - **OWNER** and **ACCOUNTANT**: Have full management capabilities
   - **EMPLOYEE**: Can create and view transactions and invoices but cannot modify or delete them

3. **Financial Reports and Budget Management**:
   - **OWNER** and **ACCOUNTANT**: Have full access to all reports and budget features
   - **EMPLOYEE**: Can view budgets and alerts but cannot access financial reports or create budgets

4. **Data Operations**:
   - **OWNER** and **ACCOUNTANT**: Can both export and import data
   - **EMPLOYEE**: Can only export data, cannot import

5. **System Management**: While not explicitly coded in the controllers, owners typically have additional system-level privileges that aren't exposed through the API, such as:
   - User management
   - System configuration
   - Access to sensitive financial information

6. **Responsibility Scope**:
   - **OWNER**: Has ultimate responsibility for the financial system and can perform all operations
   - **ACCOUNTANT**: Focused on financial operations, record-keeping, and reporting
   - **EMPLOYEE**: Focused on day-to-day operational tasks like recording transactions and creating invoices

## Conclusion

The Small Business Accounting System implements a comprehensive role-based access control system with three distinct roles:

1. The **OWNER** role has full access to all features, providing complete control over the financial system.

2. The **ACCOUNTANT** role has extensive access to most features, with limitations only on critical operations like account deletion, allowing accountants to perform their financial duties effectively.

3. The **EMPLOYEE** role has limited access focused on day-to-day operational tasks, allowing employees to record transactions and create invoices while restricting access to sensitive financial information and system management functions.

This tiered approach to permissions ensures that users have access to the features they need for their specific responsibilities while maintaining appropriate security and data integrity controls.
